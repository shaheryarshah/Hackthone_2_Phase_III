# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo Extended Features

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items have been verified. Specification is ready for `/sp.plan` phase.

### Validation Results:

**Content Quality**: PASSED
- Specification focuses entirely on user needs and business outcomes
- Written in clear, non-technical language suitable for stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: PASSED
- No clarification markers remain - all requirements are well-defined
- All 35 functional requirements are specific and testable
- All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Each user story has complete acceptance scenarios
- 7 edge cases identified with clear handling strategies
- Scope is bounded to 7 specific features
- Assumptions section documents dependencies and constraints

**Feature Readiness**: PASSED
- All 7 user stories have acceptance criteria through scenarios
- Each story includes independent test approach
- Success criteria cover performance, usability, and business metrics
- No framework, language, or API details included

The specification is comprehensive, clear, and ready for implementation planning.
